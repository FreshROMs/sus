**Fresh 6.5 Update (Android 14)**

It's never been easier to be awesome. Fresh 6 is here, and it's as magical as ever. With One UI 6 on a rock-solid, stable, and well-maintained base, this is the most stable One UI your device has ever received.

### What's New

**More Awesome AI**

Fresh AI is here. Fresh 6 brings the power of AI to your fingertips. Be more productive with Chat Assist, Note Assist, and Transcript Assist. Edit your photos with AI-powered editing tools, and enjoy the convenience of AI-driven features that make your phone smarter and more intuitive.

Whether you're composing emails, taking notes, or editing photos, Fresh's AI features are designed to enhance your experience and help you get things done faster and more efficiently.
  
**More Awesome Desktop** 

Transform your phone into a productivity powerhouse with Samsung DeX, now included in Fresh. Multitask with ease, run multiple apps simultaneously, and enjoy a desktop-like experience right on your device, and wirelessly too.

Whether you're browsing the web, editing documents, or just enjoying your favorite content, DeX brings the power of a desktop to your pocket. 
  
**Get suggestions based on text in images**  

When text appears in an image in Gallery or other apps, actions will be recommended based on the text. For example, if you take a picture of a sign with a phone number or web address on it, you can tap to call the number or visit the site. 

Text extraction and suggestion features are only supported for English, Korean, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese.

**More Awesome Look**

Improved visuals and animations make Fresh 6 a delight to use. With a fresh new look, smoother transitions, and enhanced animations, your phone feels more alive than ever.

And of course, Fresh has Zest, the customization center that lets you personalize your phone to your heart's content. From themes to icons, Zest gives you the power to make your phone truly yours.

**More Awesome Screen**

Take care of your eyes with Fresh's new screen features. With adaptive color tone, your phone now automatically adjusts the color temperature of your screen based on the ambient light, reducing eye strain and making it easier to read in different lighting conditions.

And with Digital Wellbeing features, you can set screen time limits, track your usage, and even enable bedtime mode to help you get a good night's sleep.

### Circle to Search with Google

Simply circle, highlight, or tap anything on your screen to search for it without switching apps. Whether it's identifying a landmark in a photo, translating text in real-time, or finding products you see online, intelligent search is always at your fingertips.
